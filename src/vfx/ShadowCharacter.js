/**
 * Two shadows of the character, summoned to hunt for it.
 *
 * ## What a shadow is
 *
 * A full clone of the rig — body, armour, weapon, everything hanging off a bone
 * — with every material replaced by one black surface. It is the same silhouette
 * moving through the same frames, which is the whole read: two more of *you*
 * standing where you are not.
 *
 * The clone carries its own skeleton (`SkeletonUtils.clone`), which is what buys
 * the two of them somewhere to stand: a skinned mesh in three's default
 * `attached` bind mode cancels its own world matrix out of the skin, so a clone
 * pointed at the original's bones is welded to it and cannot be offset by so
 * much as a millimetre.
 *
 * ## Its life
 *
 * `V` arms the mark rather than summoning (`combat/TargetMarking.js`); the pair
 * steps out on the last lock, one shadow to each body the player picked. Each
 * runs one errand and it is over:
 *
 *  - **emerge** — born standing *inside* the character in its exact pose (every
 *    cloned node's local transform copied off the node it was cloned from, one
 *    vector copy per joint, so a turn or a gait blend lands on the shadow the
 *    same frame it lands on the body) and slid out to a mark beside it.
 *  - **crouch** — the pose copy stops, its own mixer takes the skeleton over,
 *    and it holds a crouch on that mark for `settings.shadowCharacter.crouch`
 *    seconds. This beat is the point of the whole summon: two things step out of
 *    you, settle, take their mark, and only then move.
 *  - **hunt** — one enemy each, never the same one twice, run down at
 *    `hunt.speed` with the body turning into the chase.
 *  - **strike** — one of the player's own attacks, named by
 *    `strike.move` and thrown with that move's numbers. The run does *not* stop
 *    on the animator's mark: it stops far enough out that the move's own warp
 *    window has ground to cover (`_lunge`), and the warp then carries the body
 *    the rest of the way exactly as `animation/Attack.js` carries the player's —
 *    which is what lets a shadow finish with the slide cut, running the body
 *    down, dropping into the slide and opening it on the way past. The frame the
 *    blow lands is read off the action's own clock, and `onStrike` fells the
 *    body with the striking move's own force.
 *  - **dissolve** — a noise burn up the silhouette, the same device the enemies
 *    die by, in the rim's own violet. Then it is gone, and when the last one
 *    goes `active` clears itself so `V` can send them out again.
 *
 * Because the shadows leave the body, they live in world space under `group`
 * (which belongs to the play stage) rather than under the character's transform.
 *
 * ## How it looks
 *
 * One material per shadow, patched once (see the shader at the bottom of this
 * file): the **dark**, which is just the material's own colour, since a shadow
 * is a silhouette; the **fresnel**, a rim on every grazing angle, which is what
 * stops a black body from reading as a hole in the screen; and the **burn**,
 * which only exists while it is leaving.
 *
 * Everything is read from `settings.shadowCharacter` every frame, so the whole
 * look is live under the editor's "Shadow character" folder while the pair is
 * out there.

/**
 * The rim and the burn.
 *
 * ## The rim
 *
 * One dot product and one power: every grazing angle emits, which is what draws
 * the silhouette. Without it a black body under a cool key reads as a hole in
 * the screen rather than as something standing there.
 *
 * ### Why it is divided by the exposure
 *
 * The rim is an HDR value — at `emissive` 2.2 its brightest channel is well over
 * 1 — and everything above 1 is the tone mapper's to fold back down. ACES does
 * that per channel *and* desaturates as it goes, so the same colour comes out at
 * a different saturation, and a different hue, for every exposure it is fed at.
 * The two stages do not share one: the play stage grades at 0.98 and the
 * character screen at 0.49, so a rim tuned on the set arrived out in the world
 * twice as hot and washed toward white.
 *
 * Dividing by the exposure the renderer is about to multiply by cancels it: both
 * stages hand the tone mapper the same radiance, and the picker's colour is the
 * colour on screen in either place.
 *
 * ## The burn
 *
 * `discard` rather than alpha, for the same reason the enemies' is: a dissolving
 * body would otherwise have to be sorted against everything else transparent in
 * the frame, and there is no ordering that is right for something standing
 * inside a bank of ground mist.
 *
 * The threshold mixes noise with height so the burn *rises* — pure noise reads
 * as static eating the model and pure height as a wipe. Somewhere between the
 * two is the thing that looks like a shadow coming apart.
