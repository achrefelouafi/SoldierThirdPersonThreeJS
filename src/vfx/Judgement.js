/**
 * Judgement: a seal opens over a marked body and a fist comes down through it.
 *
 * ## The shape of it
 *
 * Six beats, all of them in `settings.judgement.beats`, and one state each:
 *
 *  - **open** — the seal writes itself into the air over the mark, one full turn
 *    anticlockwise from the top (`vfx/SummonSeal.js`), irising out as it goes.
 *  - **charge** — held. The circle tightens and brightens and nothing else
 *    happens, which is the beat that makes the blow inevitable rather than
 *    sudden. Take it out and the whole move reads as a projectile.
 *  - **fall** — the fist comes through, accelerating: `t²`, which is what a
 *    dropped thing actually does.
 *  - **impact** — one frame, and everything happens on it. Whoever is under the
 *    knuckles is felled, the world nearly stops, the lens is kicked, the ground
 *    opens (`vfx/ShockRing.js`) and throws up what it is made of
 *    (`vfx/DustBurst.js`).
 *  - **dwell** — the fist sits on the result, cooling. The single cheapest way
 *    to make a blow feel heavy is to leave the thing that landed exactly where
 *    it stopped for half a second.
 *  - **withdraw / close** — pulled back up through the seal, which then folds.
 *
 * ## The trick the whole thing hangs on
 *
 * A fist falling out of a circle is a prop unless the circle is a *hole*. So the
 * fist's material discards every fragment above the seal's plane and burns a
 * line where it crosses, and the forearm is stretched in the vertex shader so it
 * always reaches that plane however high the seal was hung. What is on screen is
 * therefore never a floating arm: it is an arm coming through something, at any
 * height, at any point in the drop, with no keyframes anywhere.
 *
 * ## What it owns, and what it does not
 *
 * It owns the seal, the ring, the dust, one light and the fist. It does **not**
 * decide who is marked (`combat/TargetMarking.js` does, exactly as it does for
 * the shadows) and it does not decide what being hit means — `onStrike` carries
 * the blow out with `settings.judgement.force`, which is the same block shape
 * every melee move states its impact in, so `App#_onStrike` takes it without
 * knowing which move it came from.

/**
 * Everything you actually see.
 *
 * The model has no colour map. That is not a limitation to work around here, it
 * is the brief: there is nothing to light, so nothing is lit — the base is
 * near-black and every bright thing below is *emitted*, in four terms.
 *
 * ## 1. The relief, which places the other three
 *
 * The one thing the export knows about its own surface is its normal map. After
 * `normal_fragment_maps` the shader is holding both the mapped normal and the
 * surface it was applied to (`nonPerturbedNormal`), and the angle between them
 * is how hard the map is bending the light at this fragment — near zero across
 * the flats of the forearm, and large down every knuckle crease, seam and fold.
 * That number is the whole placement system: it darkens the surface where a
 * crevice would hold shadow (`uCavity`, which is cavity occlusion by another
 * name) and it lights the same crevices from inside (`uVein*`). The sculpt
 * therefore draws itself, out of the only map there is.
 *
 * The map that would elsewhere say *what colour* here says *what shape*, and
 * the shape is all that was shipped.
 *
 * ## 2. The rim
 *
 * A fresnel, taken on the **mapped** normal rather than the geometric one — so
 * the silhouette does not merely outline the arm, it breaks up along every
 * ridge the sculpt has, and the grazing light crawls as the fist turns. On a
 * geometric normal this is a clean neon outline; on this one it is a wet edge.
 * It is also what keeps a near-black object from reading as a hole punched in a
 * night sky, which is the same job it does on the summoned shadows.
 *
 * ## 3. The cut, and the line on it
 *
 * Every fragment above the seal's plane is discarded and a band of light is
 * burned just under it. This is the effect: without it there is a floating
 * forearm, and with it there is something reaching through.
 *
 * ## 4. The moment
 *
 * `uCharge` runs the veins from violet to white as the blow gathers and
 * `uFlash` puts the whole surface briefly over the top of that on contact,
 * weighted toward the silhouette so the fist blows out at its edges first.
 *
 * Every emissive is divided by the frame's exposure for the reason set out on
 * the shadow character's rim: ACES desaturates as it clips, so a colour picked
 * at one exposure arrives at a different hue at another.
